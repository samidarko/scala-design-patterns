  * What is the Prototype Pattern
  * * Creating new objects (instances) by cloning (copying) other objects
  * * Allows for adding of any subclass instance of a known super class at run time
  * * When there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime
  * * Reduces the need for creating subclasses
