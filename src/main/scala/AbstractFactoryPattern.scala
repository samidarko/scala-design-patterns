/**
  * Created by samidarko on 10/18/16.
  * It is like a factory but everything is encapsulated
  * * The method that orders the object
  * * The factories that build the object
  * * The final objects
  * * The final objects contain objects that use the Strategy Pattern
  * * * Composition: Object call fields are objects
  * When to use the Abstract Factory Pattern
  * * Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
  * * Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed, dynamically at run time
  * * You can model anything you cam imagine and have those objects interact through common interfaces
  * * Negative: Things can get complicated
